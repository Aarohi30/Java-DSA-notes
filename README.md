## Java DSA – Interview Preparation

This repository contains Java Data Structures & Algorithms problems
that I recently reviewed and practiced as part of interview preparation.

Focus areas:
- Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Sorting, Recursion, BST, Algorithms, Time and space complexity
- Common interview patterns
- Clean Java implementations with explanations

Note:
This repository is forked from open-source resources and modified
with my own notes, explanations, and refactoring for learning purposes.
